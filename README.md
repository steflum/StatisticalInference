##Overview
This repository contains files pertaining to the class project/assignment for the Coursera Statistical Inference class offered by Johns Hopkins University. This class is the 6th class in the Data Science specialization certification offered by Coursera. The specialization is taught primarily by Brian Caffo, along with Roger Peng and Jeff Leek.

##Content
The project consisted of two parts and is broken out into four files, the R Markdown files and the PDFs:  

1. Assignment-Part1.Rmd
      + This file contains the R Markdown file of the first part of the assignment submitted as the final project for this course. The report explored the idea of the Central Limit Theorem and demonstrated how it applied to large distribution sizes.  
2. Assignment-Part1.PDF
      + This is the published PDF of Item 1.
3. Assignment-Part2.Rmd  
      + This file contains the R Markdown file of the second part of the assignment submitted as the final project for this course. The report was a demonstration of basic data analysis skills and a test of my knowledge of confidence levels and T-tests.
4. Assignment-Part2.PDF
      + This is the published PDF of Item 3.

This was my first attempt at conducting data analysis (outside of basic error analysis in lab classes in school). I intend to increase my knowledge and develop more skill over time as I continue through this specialization and work through more analyses.
